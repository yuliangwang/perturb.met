# perturb.met
This is a method to identify metabolites around which there are significant transcriptional changes. 
Metabolic aberrations are a prominent feature of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD). Different neuronal subtypes have selective vulnerability in AD. Despite the recent advance of scRNA-seq of AD brains, genome-scale metabolic network changes in  neuronal subtypes have not been systematically studied with detail. To bridge this knowledge gap, we developed a computational method called perturb-Met that can uncover transcriptional dysregulation centered at hundreds of metabolites in a metabolic network. perturb-Met successfully recapitulated known glycolysis, cholesterol, and other metabolic defects in APOE4-neurons, many of which are missed by current methods. perturb-Met revealed that each of the four neuronal sub-types in the entorhinal cortex shows distinct sub-type-specific metabolic changes in AD, in mitochondrial complex I metabolism, ganglioside metabolism, heparan sulfate metabolism, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism, respectively. perturb-Met also revealed significant changes in protein glycosylation in neuron sub-types specifically enriched in AD brains. These discoveries provide potential metabolic explanations for selective neuronal vulnerability in AD.
